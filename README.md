# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming questions from Codewars. I have solved problems of various difficulty levels based on the kyu ranking system.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the kyu level of the problems. Each directory contains the solutions to multiple problems of that particular difficulty level. Additionally, each problem solution is stored in a separate JavaScript file.

â”œâ”€â”€ 7-kyu
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem1.js
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem2.js
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ 6-kyu
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem1.js
